## What is NAOqi?

[NAOqi](http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/index.html) is the name of the main software that runs on the robot and controls it.

- It runs on the robot, under OpenNAO distribution.
- It can also run on your computer in order to test your code on a [simulated robot](http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/dev/tools/robot-simulation.html#choregraphe-reference-simulated-robot).
